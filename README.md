Inventory Management Sales Prediction

This project uses Linear Regression to predict sales amounts for an inventory management system based on product categories, quantity, and price per unit. The dataset includes features such as customer demographics, product details, and transaction values. Feature engineering was applied to improve model performance by deriving the Total Value (Quantity × Price per Unit).

Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Linear Regression
Key Features:

  - Data preprocessing and encoding
  - Feature engineering for improved prediction
  - Model evaluation using Mean Squared Error and R² Score
